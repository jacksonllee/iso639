# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The version number is based on [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/).
The specific format is `YYYY.(M)M.(D)D`,
where the month and day may be single-digit because Python doesn't allow zero-padded
major/minor/micro version numbers like `05` (it'd have to be just `5`).
